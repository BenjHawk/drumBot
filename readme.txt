HyDrum loop machine; read me

The drumBot loop machine is a browser application for creating, saving and playing drum loops. The app can be started from every browser on desktop computers, tablets and mobile devices. To aid usability on devices apart from the desktop computers the design of the drumBot will adapt depending on the display resolution of your device.
For the drum loops up to six different sounds can be used simultaneously (Snare, Bass, HiHat, Tom1 & 2, Cymbal). The tempo of one down beat is adjustable from 40 beats per minute (bpm) to 208 bpm. For each sound every 1/8 note of a measure can be selected or deselected individually to allow a maximum of flexibility and creativity while developing loops. To add even more flexibility to the loop generating process, the volume of each drum sound can be changed individually so that different mixes are possible. Furthermore, the app includes a master volume button to decrease or increase the volume of all instruments of the loop.
The drumBot application not only offers the possibility to instantly generate loops as a guest on the homepage but also allows users to register on the web page.  For registered users additional features were included to the drumBot with the possibility to save an infinite number of drum loops permanently in database, being clearly the most important function. Upon login of a registered user, all his saved drum loops are loaded to the application, they can be selected by a drop-down menu and they can also be modified and saved again to the database. Alternatively, loops can also be deleted by logged in users via the delete button of the application. 
As an additional feature the application has two screens. The left screen shows all important parameters of the loop like tempo, volume, meter, mode and effects at one glance. The right screen shows a real-time animation as a graphical representation loop when the loop is played. Furthermore, also buttons have a different colour when they are selected to allow optical evaluation of a drum loop at all times. 
For future development it is planned to equip the drumBot with multiple sound effects to modify loops and different meters in which drum loops can be developed. The required drop-down menus are already included in this initial version of the drumBot and will be populated with the next major update of the app.
Enjoy the drumBot web-based drum machine for musical projects as well as for having fun playing around!

Cheers, 
The developers
